## About BBW Heroes

BBW Heroes is a movement which has the goal to encourage informatics students of the BBW to share their works with others and the world. We try to provide a platform and resources but also a community for a helping hand or group projects. Doesn't matter if you've just began or are in the final year of your apprenticeship, we want to motivate everyone to be a part of this and make something great for many more apprentices to come.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** Our intention and main goal is to create a platform to share and grow together. However, it is not our responsibility how the resources are used. Just be sure to follow the licensing, if any, for the respective resource and code and do not sell anything as yours that is not made by you.
